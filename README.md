3. Moments

Given a probability transition matrix, PTM, and a vector of values for each state, X, Moments() will produce a table output that displays the mean, variance, covariance, and autocorrelation associated with the PTM. Note that these are not based on simulation, but on the explicit formulas suggested by Paul Klein (2019).
